# Machine Learning Basics Course

This repository collects the lab assignments I completed in the **Machine Learning Basics (ML 1)** course. Each notebook walks through an end‑to‑end workflow: exploratory data analysis, model selection & justification, hyper‑parameter tuning, and final evaluation with take‑away insights.

## Structure
